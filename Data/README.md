# Topic: Research on Improving the Quality of Online Customer Support Using Artificial Intelligence 

📋 Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation of an AI-Powered Smart Support Assistant (SSA) designed to enhance online customer support quality in e-commerce environments. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate, context-aware, and empathetic customer service responses.

## Key Features

Multi-channel Data Integration: Processes customer queries from chat, email, and social media
Intent & Sentiment Detection: Identifies customer needs and emotional tone using fine-tuned BERT models
Context-Aware Responses: Retrieves relevant knowledge from FAQs, CRM history, and past interactions
Human-in-the-Loop Escalation: Automatically routes complex or emotionally charged queries to human agents
Continuous Learning: Incorporates feedback loops for ongoing system improvement

🎯 Research Objectives

Analyze limitations of existing customer support systems (response delays, lack of personalization, scalability issues)
Explore AI technologies (chatbots, NLP, machine learning) for addressing identified challenges
Design and test AI-driven solutions to improve response accuracy, personalization, and customer satisfaction

🏗️ System Architecture
The methodology follows a modular BPMN-based workflow:
Customer Query → Data Preprocessing → Intent & Sentiment Analysis 
→ Contextual Knowledge Retrieval → AI Response Generation → Human Escalation (if needed)
→ Feedback Collection → Model Update

First Contact Resolution (FCR): Demonstrated ability to resolve common queries without escalation
Sentiment Detection: High accuracy in identifying emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative)
CSAT Impact: Improved customer satisfaction through empathetic, context-aware responses

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
bashPython 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-customer-support-thesis.git
cd ai-customer-support-thesis

# Install dependencies

Quick Start
python# Example: Intent Classification
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pre-trained model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./models/intent_classifier')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Classify query
query = "I can't log into my account"
inputs = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)
prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
