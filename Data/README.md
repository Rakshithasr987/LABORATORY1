5. Clustering Support Cases & Teams	Aggregated quality indicators (resolution time, CSAT, reopen rate, sentiment slope, handoffs)	Unsupervised ML — K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, UMAP/t-SNE visualization	Clustered profiles: “High-quality,” “Moderate,” “Low-quality” teams/tickets with recommendations.

Input: Customer support event streams.
o Support channels events such as chat messages, tickets, emails, phone-call transcripts (ASR), chatbot handoffs, agent notes, satisfaction survey responses, and social-media support mentions.
Black Box Processing: Statistical + Process Mining methods.
Statistical Methods
Calculate quality & operational indicators such as time-to-resolution, first-contact resolution (FCR) rate, number of message turns, average handle time, re-open rate, and CSAT/NPS trends (using descriptive statistics, regression, and time-series analysis).
Process Mining Methods
Discover process models (how tickets/conversations flow from open → triage → work → escalate → resolve/close).
Apply process discovery (extracts knowledge from event logs to create graphical models of support processes).
Identify bottlenecks (queues, handoff points, escalation loops, retry/reopen patterns).
Output: Support quality assessment & visual insights.
Actionable Insights:
•	For Support Managers:
·	See bottlenecks in workflows (e.g., long triage times, frequent escalations).
·	Compare team SLA compliance and CSAT across channels.
•	For Researchers:
·	Get a reproducible event-based assessment method for support quality and operational health.
•	For Customers / Product Owners:
·	Decide whether support for a product/plan is responsive and trustworthy (e.g., “Average resolution time: 48 hours; CSAT: 3.2/5”).
AI Improvement End-to-End Solution Perspective
Input Layer (support events, metadata, transcripts, survey scores) →
AI Processing Layer (predictive models, anomaly detection, NLP, clustering, recommendations) →
Output Layer (quality score, alerts, summaries, recommendations, cluster profiles).
1.	Predictive Support Quality Modeling (ML)
Train machine learning models on historical support events + metrics to predict future support outcomes.
Input: Arrival rate of tickets, initial intent, customer tier, agent workload, backlog size, past CSAT for customer, conversation-level features (sentiment trajectory), and channel.
AI Processing: Train supervised ML models. Algorithms — Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost), or Neural Networks (transformer-based encodings + MLP; temporal models for sequences).
Output: Probability that a ticket will have low CSAT or will escalate; expected time-to-resolution; predicted SLA breach risk (e.g., “Ticket has 72% chance to breach SLA in next 8 hours”).
2.	Anomaly Detection in Support Behavior
Use AI to detect unusual patterns in support event logs to flag early operational or quality degradation.
Examples of anomalies:
•	A sudden spike in unresolved high-priority tickets.
•	Chats routed repeatedly to bot fallback or human handoff.
•	Sudden drop in average sentiment or CSAT.
Input: Time-series data of support activity (tickets per hour/day by product/channel, open vs closed counts, average handle time, bot fallback rate, negative sentiment ratio).
AI Processing: Methods — Autoencoders (multivariate time-series), Isolation Forest, Seasonal-aware forecasting + residual analysis (LSTM-forecast + anomaly on residuals), or change-point detection.
Output: Alerts such as “Unusual spike in unresolved premium-tier tickets” or “Negative sentiment ratio doubled this morning — investigate recent release/incident.”
3.	Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Conversations & Tickets
Analyze textual content of initial messages, conversation transcripts, agent notes, and survey comments.
Use NLP to detect:
•	Intent and sub-intent (billing question, technical bug, refund request, feature request).
•	Sentiment and emotion trends (customer frustration, calm, confusion).
•	Topic modeling (recurring problem areas: login issues, payment failures, delivery delays).
•	Toxicity / escalation triggers (abusive language, legal/priority keywords).
Input: Text data from ticket subjects, full conversation transcripts (chat/email/ASR), agent replies, and post-interaction survey text.
AI Processing: Tools & methods — fine-tuned transformers (BERT/T5/BART), embeddings (SBERT/GPT embeddings), topic models (LDA / BERTopic), sentiment classifiers, toxicity classifiers, extractive/abstractive summarization.
Subtasks:
•	Intent classification (multi-label).
•	Entity extraction (order numbers, product IDs, error codes).
•	Conversation-level sentiment trajectory and escalation detection.
•	Automated summarization (one-paragraph ticket summary for dashboards and handoffs).
Output: Support health indicators and textual outputs: “30% of this week’s tickets are billing-related; sentiment trend for Billing tag fell from 0.2 to -0.5”; per-ticket summaries: “Customer angry about duplicate charge; wants refund; provided txn ID XYZ; escalated to billing.”
4.	AI-Assisted Process Mining
Beyond discovering static process models, use AI to predict deviations and recommend operational changes.
•	Capabilities:
•	Predict process deviations (likelihood a ticket will be re-opened or escalate).
•	Recommend optimal routing and workflow sequences (learn which routing patterns correlate with fast resolution and high CSAT).
Example: Train a classifier to label ticket traces as “efficient” vs “inefficient” based on duration, handoffs, and outcome.
Input: Event logs representing ticket lifecycles (events: create, assign, respond, escalate, close, reopen), agent role changes, and timestamps.
AI Processing:
•	Classify traces as “efficient vs inefficient” using sequence models or tree-based models on engineered trace features.
•	Predict likelihood of deviation (e.g., re-open probability, escalation probability) and simulate counterfactuals (“If assigned to Specialist B instead of Tier 1, predicted resolution time reduces by X hours”).
Output: Recommended workflow optimizations (“This ticket has 85% chance to reopen under current routing; suggest escalation to Tier 2 immediately”); annotated process maps showing bottlenecks with predicted probabilities.
5.	Clustering Support Cases & Teams by Quality Profiles
Use unsupervised ML to group tickets, customers, and agent teams into meaningful quality/behavior profiles.
Example clusters:
•	High-quality/resolved-fast: short handle times, positive CSAT, low re-open rate.
•	Moderate-quality: long back-and-forth, moderate CSAT, occasional escalations.
•	Low-quality/problematic: repeated re-opens, negative CSAT, multi-agent handoffs.
Lets you show patterns across products, channels, and teams rather than only individual cases.
Input: Support quality indicators from multiple tickets/agents/teams (features: avg resolution time, CSAT distribution, re-open rate, sentiment slope, number of agent handoffs).
AI Processing: Unsupervised ML — k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering on tabular + embedding features; dimensionality reduction (UMAP/t-SNE) for visualization.
Output:
•	Groups of tickets/teams: “Cluster A — fast resolution, high CSAT; Cluster B — slow, often escalated; Cluster C — bot-heavy interactions with many fallbacks.”
•	Comparison dashboards: “Your support team falls into Cluster 2: moderate quality with long triage times — recommended training on escalation handling.”
